Through their\u00a0oversight role, they provide an important check\u00a0on corruption in government and improve the\u00a0government\u2019s management of public resources\u00a0to promote development more effectively.\r\n\r\nIn the Parliament of Uganda, the accountability\u00a0committees have made important contributions\u00a0to holding government accountable on a\u00a0number of high profile cases, including financial\u00a0mismanagement of Commonwealth Heads Of\u00a0Government Meeting and Office of the Prime\r\nMinister. The committees have also highlighted\u00a0other important concerns of financial\u00a0mismanagement unearthed by the Auditor\u00a0General\u2019s reports.\r\nWhile there are other institutions involved in\u00a0the audit process, this report specifically focuses\u00a0on Parliament\u2019s role in the accountability\u00a0cycle. Despite their high level of activity,\u00a0generous support from Parliament and donors,\r\nand experienced and committed\u00a0Parliamentarians on the committees, however,\u00a0the accountability committees continue to face\u00a0challenges in considering reports, getting their\u00a0reports tabled and adopted, and receiving a\r\nresponse from Government in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\nThe lack of completion of the cycle of\u00a0accountability work means that their high level\u00a0of activity does not bear the fruit it should in\u00a0terms of tasking government to account fully for\u00a0its management of public expenditure. This\u00a0report details the findings of\u00a0research conducted on accountability\u00a0committees\u2019 consideration of Auditor General\u2019s\u00a0reports from 2006 -2013 FYs and makes\u00a0recommendations based on these findings","type":"pdf","cat":"mdocuments","owner":"Collin Rukundo","size":"1517860","modified":"1434808058","version":"1.0","show_social":"on","non_members":"on","file_status":"public","post_status":"publish","post_status_sys":"publish","doc_preview":"","downloads":"0","archived":[],"ratings":[],"rating":0}]
