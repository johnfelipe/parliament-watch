== Description ==

Creativ Shortcodes is built on top of the wonderful Simnor Shortcodes and is a very powerful, yet easy to use shortcodes plugin. Shortcodes can be generated via the new button in your editor in the Visual tab of the WordPress editor.

You can add buttons, columns, social icons and links, accordions, toggles, tabs, alert boxes, pull quotes, responsive Youtube and Vimeo videos, and maps to your site by simply filling out a few options and clicking the Insert Shortcode button.

Please note that this will not work with every theme as some theme developers will overwrite styling, as such I cannot provide support if there are formatting issues with your site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `creativ-shortcodes` folder to your to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or alternatively upload the creativ-shortcodes.zip via the plugin page of WordPress by clicking 'Add New' and select the zip from your local computer.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the page/post editor and you should see a new button on your toolbar (the icon is a red button with our /// logo mark)
4. On the popup that appears, choose which shortcode you would like to add from the left and then fill out the options on the right.
5. Click the Insert Shortcode button to add the shortcode to the editor.
